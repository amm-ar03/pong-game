This is a simple Pong game that I coded using Processing (Java). I used Processing mainly
because I was still getting familiar with axes and coordinates in coding games and the built 
in functions are so much more easier and less tedious to use. 
This took me a bit of time and alot of surfing the web to get everything to work the way it's
supposed to without looking all out of place.

It needs a bit of working on to really look good, so if i have time from other projects, I'll come 
back to it. Anyways, thanks for checking it out!!
